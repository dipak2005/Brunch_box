Plus, this cucumber salad is actually served warm. 

You’ll cook down some mustard seeds with cumin and a little coconut oil before pouring it over the cucumber.

It’ll sizzle, the flavors will marry, and this will be the best darn cucumber salad you ever had.,'''

Still, I highly recommend giving this dish a try! Yes, it’s earthy, but it’s also garlic-y, full of ginger and cumin, and even a little citrus-y, thanks to the lemon.''',
